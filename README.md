# 📚 Bookify – E-Book Store

Bookify is a simple e-book store web application built using **React**, **Bootstrap**, and **Firebase**.  
Users can upload books, explore books uploaded by others, and place orders.

This project is my **first Firebase demo project**, where the primary focus was on **core functionality** rather than UI/UX polish.
